Movie Quiz!

Because one day ill come up with a better name...

This is an app made as part of the process of teaching myself React.js. I have primarily used a combination of React.js,
React Router, React Redux Toolkit and Typescript to develop it. It's a simple app designed to be a quiz where each
question is randomly generated using the [api from The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).

Currently the standard question asks the user to assert which actor, out of the options given, starred in all of the displayed
movies. I have settled for the standard a,b,c & d format for the options but im still tweaking how many posters should be
displayed.
